# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A WordPress plugin: **Bulk URL Content Find & Replace**. An admin tool (Tools → Bulk URL Content Find & Replace) that does exact, case-sensitive find/replace inside the content of specific posts identified by a list of URLs/paths — including Elementor-built pages. Has a dry-run mode, a results dashboard, CSV export, and a persistent activity log.

There is **no build step, no package manager, and no test suite**. It is plain PHP loaded directly by WordPress; CSS/JS in `assets/` are hand-written and served as-is. To run it, drop the directory into `wp-content/plugins/` of a WordPress install and activate. Code only executes inside a WordPress runtime — there is no standalone entry point to invoke.

The committed `phpcs:ignore` annotations indicate the intended style is the **WordPress Coding Standards** (tabs for indentation, Yoda conditions, `wp_*` escaping/sanitization helpers), but no PHPCS config is committed.

## Architecture

Everything lives under the `BUCFR\` namespace and uses the `BUCFR_` constant prefix / `bucfr_` function prefix. Load order is fixed in the bootstrap file (`bulk-url-content-find-replace.php`): helper → replacer → admin page → plugin, then `Plugin::instance()->init()` on `plugins_loaded`.

Four classes, clean separation:

- **`Plugin`** (`includes/class-plugin.php`) — singleton container. Only wires up `Admin_Page` (admin context only) and loads the text domain. No business logic.
- **`Admin_Page`** (`includes/class-admin-page.php`) — the controller + view layer. Registers the Tools menu, enqueues assets *only on its own screen*, and handles three `admin-post.php` actions: `bucfr_run`, `bucfr_export_csv`, `bucfr_clear_log`. Also contains all HTML rendering (form, summary tiles, results table, updated-pages panel, activity log).
- **`Replacer`** (`includes/class-replacer.php`) — the core engine, framework-light. Constructed with `(search, replace, dry_run)`, exposes `process(array $lines)` returning `['rows' => [...], 'summary' => [...]]`. This is where to make changes to *what gets replaced and how*.
- **`Helper`** (`includes/class-helper.php`) — stateless statics + the canonical constants (`CAPABILITY = manage_options`, nonce names, `PAGE_SLUG`, activity-log option key/limit). URL normalization, line splitting/dedup, status→label/tone/dashicon maps, and the activity-log read/write/clear all live here.

### Request flow (POST-Redirect-GET)

`handle_post()` deliberately uses PRG: validate → run the `Replacer` → stash everything in **per-user transients** → `wp_safe_redirect` back to the page. `render()` then *consumes* the state (one-shot read, deletes the transient) so a browser refresh shows a clean empty form and never re-submits.

Two transients, both keyed by user ID with a 15-minute TTL:
- `bucfr_last_state_{user_id}` — full form state (inputs, errors, results) to rehydrate the screen once.
- `bucfr_last_results_{user_id}` — results only, read separately by the CSV export endpoint so export never re-processes.

The **activity log** is different and persistent: stored in the `bucfr_activity_log` *option* (not a transient), only successfully-`updated` rows from **live** runs are appended (dry-run rows never are), newest-first, hard-capped at `Helper::LOG_LIMIT` (200).

### How replacement actually works (Replacer)

Per line: `Helper::normalize_to_url()` (absolute URLs pass through `esc_url_raw`; anything else is treated as a relative path on this site) → `url_to_postid()` → load the post. Lines short-circuit into status codes: `invalid_url`, `duplicate` (post ID already seen this run), `skipped` (auto-draft / inherit / trash / revision), `not_supported` (no `edit_post` cap), `no_match`, `preview` (dry run), `updated`, `failed`.

Two content sources are searched and counted per post:
1. **Classic `post_content`** — `substr_count` to count, `str_replace` to apply, saved via `wp_update_post`.
2. **Elementor `_elementor_data`** — JSON in post meta, not in `post_content`. It is `json_decode`'d, walked recursively by `replace_in_structure()` which only touches *string leaves* (scalars are preserved to keep Elementor's setting types intact), re-encoded with `wp_json_encode` (matches Elementor's slash-escaping), and saved with `update_post_meta(..., wp_slash($json))`. The stale per-post `_elementor_css` meta is deleted immediately; a single full `Elementor\Plugin::$instance->files_manager->clear_cache()` runs once at the end of the batch (guarded by `class_exists` so it's a no-op without Elementor).

Matching is intentionally exact and case-sensitive — **no regex**. If asked to add fuzzy/regex/case-insensitive matching, that's a deliberate design departure; confirm intent first.

## Conventions to follow when editing

- **Security boilerplate is non-negotiable and already pervasive — match it.** Every entry point checks `current_user_can( Helper::CAPABILITY )`, verifies a nonce (`check_admin_referer`), `wp_unslash`es `$_POST` before use, and escapes on output (`esc_html`/`esc_attr`/`esc_url`/`esc_textarea`). Every PHP file starts with the `if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) { exit; }` guard.
- **All user-facing strings are translated** with the literal text domain `'bulk-url-content-find-replace'` (string literal, not the `BUCFR_TEXT_DOMAIN` constant — WP i18n tooling requires a literal). Use `_n()` for pluralized counts as the existing code does.
- New status codes must be added in **three** `Helper` maps together: `status_label()`, `status_tone()`, `status_dashicon()` — they're looked up in parallel by the renderer.
- Bump `BUCFR_VERSION` in `bulk-url-content-find-replace.php` when changing `assets/` files — it's the cache-busting query string for enqueued CSS/JS. Also reflect releases in both `readme.txt` (WordPress.org format) and `README.md`.
